This is app that helps you to do a face images timelapse. 
Due to restrictions of used plugins it will run only on Android,SDK>=24, also run only on arm64-v8a
Sorry, code is a bit obfuscated(by hand), but there is no other way to fit all functions.
Compile and run with 'flutter run --release';

## Functions

- Face tracking visually shows you points and parameters that you should match between taken photos
so the photos align perfectly.
